# Merespon hasil negatif

## Pendahuluan

Just few weeks a go a PhD student came to me and complaining about his negative result. His supervisors only commented to redo the experiment and change the parameters. The student have re-done the experiments but still he couldn’t get anything that support his prior working hypothesis.

And my answer was, what’s wrong with negative results, and why we couldn’t publish it. Our long discussions ended up with the following post, [Why science needs to publish negative results](https://www.elsevier.com/authors-update/story/innovation-in-publishing/why-science-needs-to-publish-negative-results) by Emma Granqvist (the above pic was borrowed from the mentioned site).
